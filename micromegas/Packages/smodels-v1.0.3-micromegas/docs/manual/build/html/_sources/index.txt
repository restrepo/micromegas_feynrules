SModelS Manual
==============

**These pages constitute the SModelS manual.**

SModelS is an automatic, public tool for interpreting simplified-model results from the LHC.
It is based on a general procedure to decompose Beyond the Standard Model
(BSM) collider signatures presenting a Z\ :sub:`2` symmetry into Simplified Model
Spectrum (SMS) topologies. Our method provides a way to cast BSM predictions
for the LHC in a model independent framework, which can be directly confronted
with the relevant experimental constraints. Our concrete implementation
currently focusses on supersymmetry searches with missing energy, for which a
large variety of SMS results from ATLAS and CMS are available. The main
ingredients are

* the decomposition of the BSM spectrum into SMS topologies
* a database of experimental SMS results
* the interface between decomposition and results database (to check limits)

as illustrated in the graphics below.
