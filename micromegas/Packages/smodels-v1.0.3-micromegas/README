============
SModelS v1.0
============


Installation
============

SModelS is a Python library that requires Python version 2.6 or later 
(but not version 3) with setuptools installed. Internally, SModelS uses the following tools:

 * Pythia 6.4.27
 * NLL-fast 1.2 (7 TeV) and 2.1 (8 TeV)
 * PySLHA (modified version)

These tools are built into SModelS, they need not be installed separately. 
In addition to setuptools, SModelS depends on the following *external* Python libraries:

 * unum
 * numpy
 * argparse
 * docutils>=0.3
 * scipy>=0.9.0

For installation, SModelS makes use of Python's *setuptools*.
Thus ::
  python setup.py install 

should install the entire project, compile the internal Pythia and NLL-fast versions
using gfortran. It should also resolve the external dependencies, i.e. install
the Python libraries listed above using e.g. *pip*.
If the python libraries are installed in a system folder (as is the default behavior),
it will be necessary to run the install command with superuser privilege.


In case the compilation of SModelS fails, it is advised to try to compile
the tools manually, by issuing "make" in the *lib/* directory.
In case the installation of the external libraries fails, you can also try to install
them manually, then rerun setup.py.  For SL6 machines, a recipe is given below.

There is also a diagnostic tool available: ::

   python smodels/tools/toolBox.py 

should list and check all internal tools (Pythia and NLL-fast) and external
(numpy, scipy, unum, ... ) dependencies.

In case everything fails, please contact smodels-users@lists.oeaw.ac.at


Installation on SL6
-------------------

Installation on an SL6 (Scientific Linux 6 or Scientific Linux CERN 6) machine
is tricky, because SModelS requires a more recent version of *scipy* than is provided by SL6. 
SModelS can be installed on SL6 by doing:

 * yum install gcc-c++ libstdc++-devel libevent-devel python-devel lapack lapack-devel blas blas-devel libgfortran python-distutils-extra

followed by:

 * pip install nose unum argparse
 * pip install numpy
 * pip install pymc
 * export LC_ALL=C; export LANG=C; pip install scipy

Note, that these steps can safely be done within a Python ``virtualenv``.

                                                                                      
Installation on SL5 and similar distributions                                         
---------------------------------------------                                         
                                                                                      
In some distributions like SL5, the python default version may be smaller than
2.6.  In these cases, ``virtualenv`` has to be set up for a python version >=
2.6.  E.g. for python 2.6, do ``virtualenv --python=python2.6 <envname>``, and
modify by hand the first line in the executable from ``#!/usr/bin/env python``
to ``#!/usr/bin/env python2.6``.  
Then perform the steps listed under ``Installation on SL6``.  



Running SModelS
===============

SModelS provides a command-line tool (runSModelS.py) for the basic functionalities,
which can be executed as:

./runSModelS.py -p <parameter file> -f <input file> -o <output file>

For help instructions:

./runSModelS.py -h

An example file on how to call the SModelS libraries from your own
Python code can be found in Example.py.

Detailed explanations on how to use SModelS, including explanations of the
output, can be found in the section ``Running SModelS'' of the SModelS manual
(docs/Manual.html).

A few example input files are provided in the inputFiles folder and can be
used to test runSModelS.py.
