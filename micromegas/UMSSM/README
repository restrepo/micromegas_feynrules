As for other micrOMEGAs models, compile the UMSSM as
		make main=main.c
and execute the code after specifying the file containing the input parameters
		./main umssm.par

In main.c :

To compute the UMSSM spectrum : 
		err=sortOddParticles(cdmName);
Then to check if there is an error in computing the spectrum :
		if(err) {printf("Can't calculate %s\n",cdmName);} 

To use the limit on the invisible Z1-width :
		if(Zinv()!=0) {printf(" Invisible Z1-width above 0.5 MeV \n");}

To use LEP limits on sparticles :
		if(masslimits()!=0) {printf(" LEP limits not satisfied \n");}
		
To use LHC limits on the new gauge boson :
		if(Zprimelimits()!=0) {printf(" LHC limits on new Zprime not satisfied \n");}

To compute low energy and Higgs physics observables :
Use UMSSMTools which contain an adaptation of several routines of NMSSMTools :
		err=UMSSMTools();
-> Output in SLHA format : - UMSSM_inp.dat		
			   - UMSSM_spectr.dat
			   - UMSSM_decay.dat
			   - SM_decay.dat

The following command displays the warning messages from UMSSMTools :
		slhaWarnings(stdout);
They are also printed in UMSSM_spectr.dat. The following warning messages can be given :
